<div id="r-series" class="section level1">
<h1>R Series</h1>
<p>These posts will follow everything I have learned or stumbled upon during my time in Mercyhurstâ€™s Data Science program. This first function is called combine and it is launched by using this line of code c(). As demonstrated below, the combine function combines all the data within the parenthesis into a list and that list is stored within the designated variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x&lt;- c(1,5,7,15)
x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  1  5  7 15</code></pre>
</div>
